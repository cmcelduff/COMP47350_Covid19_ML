This project submission is laid out as follows:
Everything is contained in a root folder named: Conor_McElduff_18970614_Nicholas_Hegarty_18317256_Homework2
Directly in this root folder you'll find the main notebook named Homework2.ipynb
There are 4 sub-directories also in this root folder:
- CSV files; contains the pre and post-preparation data from both contributors and the final merged dataset
- pkl; contains pkl files saved for the convenience of the corrector, to save them having to wait while generating their own from the notebook
- Requirements; contains 2 txt files, the conda and pip dependencies lists
- trees; contains 3 files that are referenced from the notebook and displayed there
